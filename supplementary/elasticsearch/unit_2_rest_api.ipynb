    "## What is REST?\n",
    "Roy Fielding first presented REST in 2000 in his famous dissertation as a lightweight alternative to SOAP-based web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Web API (or Web Service) conforming to the REST architectural style is a REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST APIs are very popular these days and they have mostly replaced SOAP-based web services in the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike SOAP-based web services, there is no \"official\" standard for RESTful web APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "While SOAP used XML for messages, REST generally uses JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format derived from the JavaScript language (the ubiquous web programming language originally developed for Netscape in 1994). It's syntax is basically equivalent to that of a Python dict.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of a JSON object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"name\": \"Ye\",\n",
    "    \"surname\": \"Wenjie\",\n",
    "    \"children\": [\"Yang\", \"Dong\"],\n",
    "    \"age\": 85,\n",
    "    \"height\": 175.5,\n",
    "    \"married\": true\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In RESTful APIs we have resources and we can manipulate those resources using CRUD operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resources** are REST main abstration. Basically a resource is a name for a class of objects, we can think of it as a collection of objects of the same type that we can manipulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resources are represented as URIs (ie. URLs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**CRUD** operations:\n",
    "- Create\n",
    "- Read\n",
    "- Update\n",
    "- Delete\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is **stateless**: no session information is retained by the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantics: REST implements operations using the HTTP methods:\n",
    "- GET: read\n",
    "- POST: create\n",
    "- PUT: update\n",
    "- DELETE: delete\n",
    "\n",
    "GET, PUT and DELETE methods are idempotent. POST not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The response and error codes are also based on the standard HTTP response status codes:\n",
    "- 200 OK\n",
    "- 201 Created\n",
    "- 400 Bad Request\n",
    "- 401 Unauthorized\n",
    "- 404 Not Found\n",
    "\n",
    "Using HTTP for communication allows REST APIs to be accessed all over the internet.\n",
